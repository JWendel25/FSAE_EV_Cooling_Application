# Main Pseudo code

# File Creation | Initialization Pg 0 | Dialog 1
    # If New Simulation
        # Make copy of template
        # Input new name file
        # Rename template copy
    # Load Old Simulation
        # Select old file
        # If Copy
            # Set new name
        # If Edit
    # Will handle the file name of whatever excel is being used

# Define Architecture | Main Window 1 | Pg 1
    # User uses radio buttons to select system components (& coolant?)
    # Could use text box next to radio to enter order in circuit? (1, 2, 3...)
    # Display Image graphically displaying the circuit
        # Node library used at Burns may make this easy

# Initialize Parameters | Main Window 1 | Pg 2-#
    # Initialize System Parameters (Water, Air, & FoS)
    # Input each Component Parameters (Pg 3-#)
    # Try to have tab visibility based on Pg 1 selection
    # May have to choose ind\dep var here

# Finalize Set-up | Main Window 1 | Pg #+1 (lol)
    # Try to allow them to review their sim
    # Would be great to have a picture of the circuit w/ parameters labeled & marked ind\dep

# Calculations | Dialog
    # Just some cool stuff to make it seem like the app is doing something
    # If using some scipy function, could display the solver output text 

# Results (Setpoint) | Main Window 2 | Pg 1
    # Dashboard Showing Inputs
    # Dashboard Shwoing Resulting values
    # Maybe graph showing soling point
